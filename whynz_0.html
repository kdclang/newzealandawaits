			<h1>Why New Zealand?</h1>
<img src="images/nzwalk.jpg" class="lright" alt="A walk through the New Zealand bush">			
<p>New Zealand is world renowned as an extraordinary travel destination. A little bigger than the state of Oregon (NZ is 268,021 km2, 103,483 sq mi) with only 4.47 million people, this leaves a lot of room for wild natural beauty: forests, mountains, lakes, glaciers, geothermal and volcanic landscapes, rugged coastlines and golden sand beaches. It’s not an exaggeration to say your jaw will drop multiple times a day at the stunning scenery you will encounter.</p>

<p>Sometimes when planning a vacation, it can be hard to find a destination that suits the different interests and desires of your travel companion(s). Not so with New Zealand. Our small size means you get huge diversity in what you see and do. With something to suit every taste, New Zealand has it all. Read on to learn more.</p> 

<a name="walking"></a>
<h2>Walking/Hiking (called ‘Tramping’ in NZ):</h2> <p>From day walks to multi-day hikes, there are options to suit all fitness levels. Walking and hiking is one of the best ways for you to enjoy New Zealand’s pristine wilderness and nature, giving you access to native forests, volcanic plateaus, alpine meadows and peaks, glaciers, and coastal seal and bird colonies. Our nine ‘<a href="http://www.greatwalks.co.nz/" target="_blank">Great Walks</a>’ encompass the best of our diversity and scenery.</p> 

<a name="biking"></a>
<img class="hleft" src="images/biking.jpg" alt="Biking at Te Miro"></img>
<h2>Biking:</h2> 
<p>An equally awesome way to ‘get out there’ in New Zealand is by bike. With the development of ‘<a href="http://www.nzcycletrail.com/big-idea" target="_blank"></a>Nga Haerenga</a  >’, a network of more than 1000kms of cycle trails including 23 Great Rides, New Zealanders and travelers are enjoying more of our country by bike than ever before. Offering easy day rides and multi-day options, on predominantly off-road trails, you can experience peaceful native bush, mountain and lake vistas, or meandering jaunts through vineyards. Utilizing purpose built tracks and old rail trails, the range and variety of rides available provides for both family and leisure riders as well as experienced cyclists and mountain bikers. Don’t think you have to ‘rough it’ on these rides either! If sleeping in luxury accommodations and eating at high-class restaurants is your preference, we can ensure you get the best of both worlds.</p> 

<a name="water"></a>
<img class="hright" src="images/MilfordSoundKayaking.jpg" alt="Kayaking in Milford Sound"></img>
<h2>Water Activities:</h2>
 <p>If cruising in a kayak alongside dolphins or exploring a remote, secluded beach is more your style, we have that too! We have thousands of kilometers of coastline, lakes, and rivers affording a huge array of water activities: kayaking, paddleboarding, sailing, surfing, boat cruising, diving, windsurfing, kitesurfing, and fishing.</p> 


<a name="wildlife"></a>
<h2>Unique wildlife:</h2> <p>Whale watching and swimming in the wild with dolphins, including our rare hector dolphin, are experiences treasured by many travelers. We use companies that are diligent about protecting these species and give portions of their proceeds to marine conservation. New Zealand is also a bird-watchers paradise: native birds such as the kiwi, tui, piwakawaka (fantail), and kereru (native wood pigeon), can all be spotted in the wild. We also have more than 80 different types of seabirds that breed along our coastlines, including our three penguin species. Bring your binoculars and cameras! </p>
<img src="images/Tui2.jpg" class="lleft" alt="New Zealand Tui"></img>

<a name="relax"></a>
<h2>Relaxation and Pampering:</h2> <p>If the above activities have worn you out, or you prefer a more indulging vacation, try one of our many thermal hot springs or spas. With New Zealand sitting where two tectonic plates converge, the earth’s crust is thin here, bestowing much geothermal activity and a multitude of natural hot springs. For centuries these mineral filled springs have nurtured and healed aching bodies. Nothing better after a good day’s bike riding than sliding into a natural hot spring, either on beach or in the bush (yes, they are natural!), or in a modern luxury spa. Ahhhhh.</p> 
<img src="images/hottub.jpg" class="hright" alt="New Zealand Tui"></img>

<a name="food"></a>
<h2>Food, Wine and Beer:</h2>
<p>
With world class chefs making use of local fresh ingredients, abundant seafood and pacific cuisines, New Zealand is a foodie’s dream destination. Pair sumptuous food with excellent cool-climate wines and a growing craft brew culture, and you have something for every appetite. The well-established coffee culture provides your morning or afternoon hit as well.  And don’t forget to spend time meandering through a farmer’s market or two on your travels. Mix with the locals and sample fresh and handmade goodies at these true Kiwi community gatherings.</p>

<img src="images/hobbit.jpg" class="lleft" alt="Little hobbit in Hobbiton"></img>
<a name="middleearth"></a>
<h2>Middle Earth: </h2>
<p>Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit Trilogy: It’s not surprising that New Zealand is becoming known as ‘Middle Earth’. It’s as if J.R.R. Tolkien was describing New Zealand when he created Middle Earth in his books, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Our Oscar-winning filmmaker and director, Sir Peter Jackson, brought real life middle earth to the world when the first Lord of the Rings movie was released in 2001. Jackson used over 150 locations in New Zealand for the filming of these movies and many of those locations can be visited on your own middle earth journey. The most iconic of these is Hobbiton, where The Shire is still alive and well: you can enjoy a beer at the Green Dragon Inn; look for a Hobbit in their garden; or dance under the party tree!</p> 

<a name="maori"></a>
<h2>Maori Culture:</h2>
<p>You won’t be in New Zealand long before experiencing Maori culture. Maori, Tangata Whenua, are the indigenous people of New Zealand. Arriving more than 1000 years ago from Polynesia, Maori make up 14% of our population. Your New Zealand experience is not complete without taking in some Maori culture, traditions, performing arts, crafts, art, and of course, Maori food. Unique and vibrant, Maori cultural experiences are rich in legends and story-telling.</p> 

<a name="arts"></a>
<h2>Arts and Culture:</h2> 
<p>Major public galleries, local artists’ studios, cultural, historic, and contemporary museums, heritage attractions, theatre and performing arts… all these await the more artistically or culturally inclined. New Zealand has many thriving artist communities as well. Many have options of creating your own craft, perhaps a Maori bone carving.</p>
  
<a name="adventure"></a>
<img class="lright" src="images/tessacanopy.jpg" alt="Zip Lining"></img>
<h2>Adventure Activities:</h2> <p>New Zealand is an adrenaline junkie’s dream. If you want to get your heart racing, try bungy-jumping, caving, sky-diving, rafting, jet-boating, or zip-lining, to name just a few of the awesome activities on offer! Any of these activities are incredibly fun, but imagine experiencing them against the phenomenal backdrop of New Zealand scenery. Magic!</p>
<a name="farms"></a>
<img src="images/sheep.jpg" class="hleft" alt="Sheep resting under tree"></img>
<h2>Farms and Gardens: </h2>

<p>New Zealand is an agricultural nation and a visit to a New Zealand farm enhances any trip down under. You can choose from cattle farms, high country sheep farms, herb farms, the list is endless. Many farms offer luxury accommodation with exquisite meals.  New Zealanders also love to garden, so garden lovers will find many world-class public and private gardens to stroll through and enjoy. Our long, skinny geographic shape allows both sub-tropical and alpine species to thrive here.</p> 

<p>And we haven’t even mentioned horse-riding/trekking, golf, air activities, star gazing, and the numerous other experiences awaiting you in New Zealand!
Whatever your dream vacation includes, whether predominantly hiking, or biking, or a taste of all of the above, we can create the perfect journey for you. <a href="contact.php">Contact us now</a>.</p>
