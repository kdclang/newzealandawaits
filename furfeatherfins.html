				<p>If you love all things nature, this trip is for you! You’ll experience fur seals, dolphins, sea and shore birds (including penguins, gannets, albatross, white heron, royal spoonbill, godwit), and forest birds (hihi/stitchbird, takahe, tieke/saddleback, kaka, weka to name few). Having evolved without the mammalian predators present in other countries, our birdlife is truly unique. We’ll visit eco-sanctuaries (link to wilderness page for more info) where you’ll be inspired by the efforts of countless volunteers who are working to protect our endangered native species and forests from introduced predators, restoring the forest ecosystems to their pre-human state. You’ll experience Maori culture and you’ll also meet our prehistoric lizard, the tuatara. We’ll take in the iconic scenery that New Zealand is famous for, including geothermal regions, lush rainforests, glacial and alpine vistas, and a remote wilderness fiord. We’ll take you to places that most New Zealanders haven’t yet experienced. To fully enjoy this trip, a moderate degree of fitness is required.</p> 

<p>If you love the buzz and frenzy of cities, then this tour is not for you as the majority of our nights will be in quiet, rural lodging. We’ll also spend several nights in B&B's providing you with an authentic view into life in New Zealand as you share the homes of locals for the night.</p>

<div id="features">
<h2>Day 1: Welcome to New Zealand!!</h2>
<!--
<p>We meet you in the morning at Auckland Airport (if you’ve just arrived) or in the city (if you’ve chosen to arrive a day or two early to get some rest) and begin our journey together. Within an hour we’re beyond the city and on the wild rugged west coast. At the spectacular black sand beach of Muriwai, we’ll visit a mainland breeding site for gannets, the Muriwai Gannet Colony. About 1200 pairs of adult gannets nest here each summer making it a marvelous sight. After lunch we’ll make our way south to the Miranda Shore Bird Center, where thousands of shorebirds can be seen on the shellbanks and tidal flats of the Firth of Thames. Miranda is the wintering ground for Wrybill, endemic to NZ, and unique among birds due to its sideways curving bill! Miranda is also an important wintering ground for thousands of Arctic nesting shorebirds such as the bar-tailed Godwit, Lesser or Red Knot, Stints and Sandpipers. You’ll learn their remarkable tale of migration, arriving at Miranda exhausted and hungry after their epic annual journey. We’ll be joined by a local expert who will help us fully appreciate the uniqueness and wonder of this spectacle. We’ll end our first day together in the rural town of Te Aroha, nestled into the foot of Mt. Te Aroha – the mountain of love. A soak in the natural mineral spa before bed will ensure you’re drifting off in no time, amazed that you’re making your bucket list dream come true.</p> 
-->
<p>Features: Gannets, Shore birds, hot pools<br />

Meals included: lunch, dinner</p>
<p>
<h2>Day 2: Te Aroha – Waitomo - Pukeatua, <br />Sanctuary Mountain</h2>
<!--
<p>
Well fed and rested, we make our way south to Waitomo, home of the famous glowworm caves and black water rafting! Fear not, we’ll choose a more serene and ethereal way to enjoy this natural wonder. Walking and gliding on a boat, you’ll be surrounded by the soft glow of thousands of glowworms, enough to gently light up this enormous cave and leave you with a sense of wonder. 
Then onto Sanctuary Mountain, also aptly named for its successful efforts to reintroduce native species of endangered birds and Tuatara (New Zealand’s native lizard) back into the protected wild. In a wetland setting, you’ll meet Tuatara and Takahe, both once on the brink of extinction, and now through the efforts of hundreds of dedicated conservationists and volunteers, enjoying life protected from predators, and thankfully growing in numbers. </p>
<p>
There’s not much that compares to the feeling of walking through the gates of the predator proof fence into Sanctuary Mountain. You’ll immediately be enveloped by old growth canopy and dense native forest. And one of the best ways to experience this is at night! You’ll understand why we call our forest “bush”, with its earthy, damp Jurassic Park-like wilderness. You’ll meet our Weta, an impressive pre-historic insect, as well as hear the bush at night, alive and vibrant. You’ll listen for the sounds of the kiwi, singing out its night time call. </p>
<p>
Our lodging tonight is just outside the sanctuary, so you’ll fall asleep to the sounds of the bush, thriving and vibrant. 
</p>
-->
<p>

Features: Glowworms, Tuatara, Takahe, <br />Various Native Forest Birds, Insects<br />

Meals included: breakfast, dinner</p>

<h2>Day 3: Pukeatua – Rotorua</h2>
<!--
<p> 
Good morning Birds! Let’s revisit the Sanctuary in the daylight this morning to experience the bush in a whole new way. The daytime birds are hungry and active and filling the air with their songs. Our guide will help us identify and learn about the various native bird species in the bush and you’ll be inspired by the commitment of every day New Zealanders, working to save and restore our native species.  
From feathers to fumeroles, we’ll head off to explore New Zealand’s geothermal wonders. With the earth’s crust being so thin in parts of New Zealand, we have spectacular bubbling and gurgling mudpools and geysers to marvel at. Staring at an erupting geyser and wandering amongst steaming craters, you’ll appreciate the stories you’ve heard about New Zealand’s natural history and how our islands came into being. Amidst this other-worldly setting, you’ll be introduced to New Zealand’s indigenous people, the Maori, and you’ll enjoy a Haka performance. In addition you’ll have the opportunity to see Maori apprentices at work on traditional art forms. </p>
<p>
Before or after a relaxing dinner, if you’re up for a short wander and can tear yourself away from your lovely B & B hosts, you can enjoy the North Island’s deepest, natural fresh water spring set amongst a redwood grove. At an estimated 4.5 million litres (1.2 million gallons) of crystal clear fresh water per hour, it really is worth the stroll. 
</p>
-->
<p>
Features: Various Native Forest Birds, Geothermal Region, Maori Cultural Performance, Maori Arts School<br />

Meal included: breakfast, dinner</p>

<h2>Day 4: Rotorua – Christchurch – Cheviot</h2>
<!--
<p>
This morning we fly to Christchurch to continue our journey on the South Island. We can’t wind our way through the Waipara region without stopping to enjoy the wonderful wine on offer.</p> 
<p>We’ll stop at a vineyard for lunch, as well as another couple for some wine tastings. You’ll learn about soil impact on wines, and why New Zealand is now a world leader in viticulture. As you listen to local winemakers talk about soil and climate, you’ll start to realize that New Zealanders are a nation of people who live connected to the land and the changing climes around them. One of our best food days on the trip, we’ll enjoy a fabulous dinner with our hosts tonight in our luxurious, elegant B & B. With an onsite spa treatments available, you can turn this dream vacation into a true indulgence if you choose. 
</p>
-->
<p>

Features: Vineyards, Spa treatments<br />


Meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner</p>

<h2>Day 5: Cheviot - Kaikoura – Marahau/Abel Tasman National Park</h2>
<!--
<p>
While reluctant to leave our gracious hosts, we’re off to see lions and tigers and bears, Oh my! Actually, dolphins, seals, albatross and whales! We’ll travel to the picturesque seaside town of Kaikoura, caught between the mountains and the sea, where you’ll choose either an Albatross encounter (including petrels and shearwaters), a Dolphin Encounter that allows you to swim in the wild with dolphins too, or a whale watch usually featuring sperm whales. If you’re all feathered out (is there such a thing!) then it might be time for some fins! We’ll spend the morning on the ocean, appreciating the abundant marine life and sea birds that call this spectacular place home, thanks to the upswelling currents from the nearby underwater Hikurangi trench. </p>
<p>
After lunch we’ll continue our journey north towards the glorious Abel Tasman National Park. While it’s a bit of a ride (4hrs), we’ll make stops along the way, to enjoy the seals along the coast, and even to swim in the Pelorus River (where Hobbits in barrels escaped evil Orcs) if you’re up for it! 
After a full-on first five days and our long drive today, you’ll be happy to settle into your lodging for the next three nights. 
</p>
-->
<p>

Features: Seals, Albatross, Dolphins<br /> (and Hobbits if you’re lucky!)<br />

Meals included: breakfast</span></p>

<h2>Day 6: Abel Tasman National Park</h2>
<!--
<p>You’ll awake this morning in anticipation to explore Abel Tasman National Park. After the rugged wild Kaikoura coast, contrasting turquoise blue waters and golden sand beaches await you. Helping us appreciate the science and the beauty of this magical place, we’ll spend the day with our marine scientist/environmental educator/skipper, Stew. Our personalized day can include walking, bird watching, marine mammal viewing, photography, snorkeling, responsible fishing, and paddleboarding – whatever we all decide. Abel Tasman National Park is one of those places where you pinch yourself as you’ll think you’re in a wonderland! You’ll know you’re not in Kansas anymore! 
</p>
-->
<p>

Features: Birds, Seals, Eco-Cruise<br />

Meals included: breakfast, lunch</p>

<h2>Day 7: Abel Tasman National Park</h2>
<!--
<p>
We’re at the halfway point in our journey together and you might be wanting some time to yourself to do whatever you choose. Today is your day! You have options to revisit the park by water taxi, to hang on a beach, to kayak, to hike, or maybe to bike or tour nearby Mapua and its vineyards. You can make it as low-key and relaxing, or as high energy as you wish. 
</p>
-->
<p>
Features: You choose!<br />


Meals included: breakfast </p>

<h2>Day 8: Marahau – Punakaiki - Hokitika</h2>
<!--
<p>
Farewell Abel Tasman National Park, Hello Buller Gorge and The Great Coast Road – dubbed one of the top 10 coastal drives in the world by Lonely Planet! Watch the scenery change from the tranquil waters of Abel Tasman, through the mighty Buller Gorge, to the pounding waves on the wild west coast. We’ll have plenty of time for photo stops! Cape Foulwind (aptly named by Captain Cook) is host to a seal colony that will be our welcome to the west coast. We’ll enjoy watching the waves roll in all the way from Australia on this rugged coastline. After lunch we’ll continue to the Pancake Rocks at Punakaiki. Yes they do look like Pancakes! Formed 30 million years ago, these limestone layers have been sculpted by nature to produce unique and bizarre shapes and blowholes that are most spectacular during high tide and high winds. We’ll see what performance awaits us at our show! </p>
<p>
When ready, we’ll continue south to our lodging for the evening. </p>
-->
<p>
Features: Seals<br />

Meals included: breakfast, lunch</p>

<h2>Day 9: Hokitika – Okarito - Fox Glacier</h2>
<!--
<p>
If you awake itching for more feathers, fear not! Today we enjoy the morning in the funky, artsy seaside town of Hokitika before setting off to explore New Zealand’s largest unmodified coastal wetland. Feeding ground to the Kotuku (white heron) and Royal Spoonbill, this lagoon is best explored by kayak, enabling us to get up close to the flora and fauna and soak in the scenic grandeur of this magical place. The quiet little settlement of Okarito will make you think you’ve stepped back in time and you’ll be reluctant to leave. </p>
<p>
We’ll rest for the night under the shadow of Fox Glacier. 
</p>
-->
<p>
Features: Kotuku, Royal Spoonbill<br />

Meals included: breakfast, lunch</span></p>

<h2>Day 10: Fox - Wanaka</h2>
<!--
<p>
We’ll plan on gorgeous weather this morning as we wander around Lake Matheson and enjoy stunning reflective views of Mt Cook, Fox Glacier, and the Southern Alps. Given the beauty of this pristine lake, we’ll even enjoy it if it drizzles! Then we’ll hike to the terminal face of Fox Glacier, a river of ice that carved out steep valley walls in its advance to and retreat from sea. </p>
<p>
Yet again, be prepared for dramatic scenery changes as we leave the rugged west coast and head inland following the gorgeous waters of the glacial Haast River. As we wind through the Haast Pass towards Wanaka, we’ll make several stops for short walks through rainforest to waterfalls and torquoise rivers and pools. We’ll picnic at one of these magical spots for lunch. As we descend towards Wanaka, Lake Hawea greets us with its breathtaking grandeur! We will land eventually on the shores of Lake Wanaka, where you’ll stroll from your lakeview room after dinner to watch the sun slide behind the surrounding mountains. You just might have to pinch yourself again! And the best part, you get to do this again tomorrow night!</p>
-->

<p>

Features: Glacier, Rainforest<br />

Meals included: breakfast, dinner</p>

<h2>Day 11: Wanaka</h2>
<!--
<p>
Wanaka is set amidst a natural wonderland of mountains, glaciers, rivers and lakes. You’re bound to fall in love with this special place! You’ll spend the day on a guided nature encounter that glides you across Lake Wanaka on a boat cruise, takes you on a nature walk on an island nature reserve, and spends the afternoon on a leisurely 4WD trip that takes you into the high country to a sheep station. You’ll contribute to the ecological restoration of this stunning nature reserve by planting a native tree on the island.  </p>
-->
<p>
Features: Native Forest Birds,<br /> Glacial and Alpine vistas<br />

Meals included: breakfast</p>


<h2>Day 12: Wanaka – Queenstown – Te Anau</h2>
<!--
<p>
We bid farewell to Wanaka and cross over the highest main road in New Zealand, the crown range road, into Queenstown. Wow, Queenstown! There is so much on offer in Queenstown that we allow you to choose how you want to spend the majority of the day. Let us help you select from a huge variety of activities on offer: scenic helicopter or plane tours, biking, hiking, or wine tour, bungy-jumping, fishing, a spa visit… the list is endless, and the tough choice is yours to make. 
After such an amazing day, you’ll wonder how things can get any better. But they do. We head off this afternoon to Te Anau, our departure gate for your wilderness overnight adventure tomorrow – Doubtful Sound.</p> 
-->
<p>
Features: You choose!<br />

Meals included: breakfast, dinner</p>

<h2>Day 13: Te Anau – Doubtful Sound</h2>
<!--
<p>
This trip just keeps getting better! Today offers a true once in a lifetime experience – an overnight boat trip in the wilderness environment of Doubtful Sound. It’s a quick 30 minute drive from Te Anau to Manapouri. You’ll already think you’ve stepped back in time as you enter this lovely lakeside settlement and head off on a 45 minute boat cruise across the stunning Lake Manapouri. Then you’ll be met on the other side and transported over the Wilmot Pass, and down to Doubtful Sound. Rugged, remote, and lush with rainforest, this sound will take your breath away. You’re likely to see dolphins, fur seals, penguins, and be able to feed albatross. You’ll be able to fish, kayak, swim, or just breathe in the serenity and peacefulness of this exquisite wilderness. Completely disconnected from the rest of the world, you’ll experience the power and solitude of Fiordland.  Your meals will be wild harvested; venison previously caught by your skipper, and crayfish and fish on the boat. Dedicated and passionate about this World Heritage area, your crew will ensure your experience in this sound is extraordinary. Enjoy a drink with friends while the sun goes down, and be lulled to sleep by the sound of silence. </p>
-->
<p>
Features: seals, penguins, dolphins, birds, <br />overnight Wilderness Cruise<br />

Meals included: breakfast, lunch, dinner</p>


<h2>Day 14: Manapouri - Queenstown</h2>
<!--
<p>
Wake to stillness of the Fiord and enjoy the grandeur around you. Slowly and gently, we’ll reintegrate you back into reality with a return trip back to Manapouri, and a meander back to Te Anau for lunch. We’ll journey our way back to Queenstown this afternoon, at a pace that works for the group. 
For our last evening together in New Zealand, we’ll enjoy a group dinner from the splendor above Queenstown. We’ll watch the sun go down over the mountains and share stories of our favourite moments of the trip. </p>
-->
<p>
Features: seals, penguins, dolphins, birds<br />

<p> 
After a lovely breakfast with our gracious hosts, we’ll say our farewells. Depending on your departure time, you’ll have the day to do whatever you choose. Maybe it’s picking up a few momentos for family or friends in the array of shops in Queenstown. Or maybe it’s a race down the luge for a last minute adrenalie rush.  It’s up to you to decide how to spend your last few hours in our wonderful country. We’ll ensure you get to the airport safely if you’re leaving today, or to your new accommodation if you’ve decided to stay on for a few days. And while you thought this was your ‘once in a life-time trip, you’ll be already planning your next trip to New Zealand thinking of who you’ll bring next time.  </p>

 </div >
<p><span class="bold">Meals:</span> 14 Breakfasts, 6 lunches, 8 dinners. </p>



<p><span class="bold">Accommodation:</span> A mix of lodges, cabins, B&Bs and hotels. These range from 3 – 4 star.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Note:</span> Due to several nights in small B&Bs, there is no possibility of a single room option. It is also important to note that B&B rooms can vary within the same B&B, and therefore you WILL at some stage be in a room that may seem smaller or have a lesser view for example than your trip mates. If you think this will pose a problem for you, this may not be the trip for you. </p>
<p>
Also – the overnight on the boat in Doubtful Sound provides a shared bathroom situation for all guests. We feel our choice of company, with their extraordinary crew, makes this worthwhile for one night.
