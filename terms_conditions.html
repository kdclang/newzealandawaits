				<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AWAITS LTD<br /> AND ITS USERS/CLIENTS</h2>
				<span class="bold"><p>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THESE BOOKING CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. PAYMENT OF A DEPOSIT IS ACCEPTANCE & UNDERSTANDING OF THESE CONDITIONS.</p>
<p>
*** It is strongly recommended that you purchase travel insurance cover for all eventualities. 
If you do not, you travel at your own risk. ***</p></span>


<h3>PRICES</h3>
<p>Trips are priced and sold in New Zealand dollars only. Prices include New Zealand Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 15%. Prices are subject to change in the event of supplier increases and/or GST fluctuations.
</p>
<h3>PAYMENT</h3>
<p>You can make payments in one of the following two ways: you will be invoiced and directed to make payment through Paypal, or make a New Zealand dollar bank transfer. Contact us for bank transfer details.</p>


<h3>DEPOSIT</h3>
<p><span class="bold">Ready to Go - Self-Drive<br />
Group Tours</span><br />
A 50% deposit is required at the time of booking, accompanied by your completed reservation form. This deposit is non-refundable. </p>
<p>
<span class="bold">One of a Kind - Self Drive<br />
Privately Guided</span><br />
A $200 fee, accompanied by your completed reservation form, is required immediately to begin the process of creating your personalized trip.</p>
<p>A 50% deposit is required within 7 days of confirmation of your trip arrangements to enable us to hold reservations. Luxury Lodges and Boutique B & Bs have strict deposit, payment, and cancellation conditions, which vary from property to property.</p>
<p><span class="bold">All Trips</span><br />
Full payment for any domestic NZ flights is required at the time of booking and airline terms and conditions apply.</p>


<h3>FINAL PAYMENT</h3>
<p>
Final payment is required 45 days before arrival in New Zealand for all trips. Bookings made within 45 days will require full payment at time of booking. If the full payment is not received by the required date, services will be cancelled with forfeiture of full deposit. Certain products may have different payment requirements and these will be advised at time of booking. </p>

<h3>CANCELLATION BY THE CLIENT</h3>
<p>Cancellation notice must be delivered to New Zealand Awaits in writing and be acknowledged by New Zealand Awaits in writing. The cancellation fee is determined by the date the written cancellation notice is received by New Zealand Awaits. Cancellation fees will be levied relevant to the amount of notice prior to departure as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>More than 45 days – Loss of deposit</li>
<li>45 - 30 days - 50% of total price</li>
<li>30 days or less – 100% of total price - no refund applies</li>
</ul>
<p>
We recommend travel insurance to cover such eventualities.
</p>
 
<p>
New Zealand Awaits reserves the right to cancel any trip at any time for any reason. This includes if insufficient reservations are made for a trip, or if New Zealand Awaits believes the quality of the trip or the safety of our guests would be compromised. In such cases, all monies received will be refunded 21 days before the scheduled departure of the trip. This refund will constitute full and final settlement. New Zealand Awaits is not responsible for any loss incurred on account of non-refundable or non-transferable air tickets or other unrecoverable travel costs. We recommend travel insurance to cover such eventualities.</p>


<h3>AMENDMENTS BY CLIENTS PRIOR TO TRAVEL </h3>
<p>
<span class="bold">One of a Kind - Self Drive<br />
Privately Guided</span></p>
<p>
Once your trip has been confirmed, and final payment received, any further amendments by the client incur an amendment fee of NZ$100.00 per change, plus any applicable supplier fees or charges. 
</p>

<h3>UNUSED SERVICES</h3>
<p>New Zealand Awaits will not pay any discounts or refunds for missed or unused services (activities, accommodation, meals or any other unused service) which were missed or unused by the Client due to no fault of New Zealand Awaits or its suppliers. This includes any termination of the Client’s participation in the trip due to the Client’s own fault, negligence or breach of these terms. </p>

<h3>CHANGES AFTER DEPARTURE</h3>

<p><span class="bold">By Client - Self-Drive: Ready to Go and One of a Kind</span><br />
Any changes to your self-drive itinerary that you make during your trip are to be self-arranged. All bookings and arrangements made by New Zealand Awaits Ltd are non-refundable once you have started your New Zealand trip. </p>

<p><span class="bold">By New Zealand Awaits – Group Tours and Privately Guided</span><br />
If an itinerary needs to be changed due to unforeseen circumstances, New Zealand Awaits will make every effort to keep the route as close a possible to the original and to use similar high quality accommodation and/or activities. These changes are at the discretion of the Trip leader/guide and any costs incurred as a result will be the responsibility of the Client. </p>

<p>If for any reason the trip has to be cut short, New Zealand Awaits will refund the portion of the trip that was missed. The value of the refund will be calculated on the per diem cost of the trip multiplied by the number of days missed. </p>

<h3>INSURANCE</h3>
<p>
It is strongly recommended that you purchase travel insurance for the duration of your trip. This protects you financially from unforeseen circumstances such as illness, family emergencies, lost luggage, or other situations that may affect your travel plans. </p>

<h3>ACCOMMODATION</h3>
<p>
All accommodation included in our itineraries is based on sharing a twin room with private facilities unless otherwise indicated. Single rooms may be available upon request at an additional cost. In addition, all accommodation in our itineraries are based on "Run of House" rooms, unless specifically mentioned otherwise. Accommodation management makes all room assignments New Zealand Awaits has no control over which room may be allocated. </p>

<h3>FINAL DOCUMENTS</h3>
<p>
<span class="bold">Self-Drive: Ready to Go and One of a Kind</span><br />
Upon completion and confirmation of your trip bookings, a final trip packet including a daily itinerary and all vouchers will be emailed to the email address provided on the reservation form. Should you choose to receive your documents by other means New Zealand Awaits reserves the right to charge an administration fee. </p>

<p><span class="bold">Group Tours and Privately Guided</span><br />
Upon completion and confirmation of your trip bookings, a final daily itinerary will be emailed to the email address provided on the reservation form. Your trip guide will manage all related documentation (vouchers etc) once you are on your trip. </p>

<h3>PASSPORTS AND VISAS</h3>
<p>

<p>All international visitors to New Zealand need a valid passport (valid for six months beyond your New Zealand departure date), evidence of onward travel arrangements (eg. a departing air ticket), and sufficient funds for the duration of your travel in New Zealand. Travellers from the U.S. or Canada who plan to visit for three months or less will be granted a Visitor’s Visa upon arrival. British citizens may be granted a Visitor’s Visa for up to six months on arrival. Other nationals, please refer to the above link to determine if you are from a visa-waiver country or if you are required to apply for a visitor permit in advance of your arrival. </p>

<h3>HEALTH AND AGE GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>
Please see each Group Tour description for guidelines on fitness levels. For all trips, some may feature soft adventures, and therefore require moderate physical fitness to fully enjoy the activities. 
</p>
<p>
Please inform us of any medical conditions or health restrictions you may have that may limit your participation or could put you at risk throughout the trip. We reserve the right to decline the reservation of guests who, in our opinion, may be at serious risk due to any medical conditions they may have or who may put fellow travellers at risk. </p>

<p>The minimum age for participation in our Group Tours is 18 years.<br />
There is no age restriction on our Privately Guided Trips. </p>

<h3>TRAVEL COMPANIONS – Group Tours</h3>

<p>
We extend an extra warm welcome to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals, as well as those who are LGBT- friendly and love travelling with LGBT travellers. We strive to provide you with a transformative travel experience, and trust that in joining one of our trips, you are also seeking to add to the experience of your travel companions.  If, however, any traveller is significantly diminishing the experience of other travellers, they may be asked to leave the trip at the discretion of the trip guide.</p>  


<h3>EXCLUSIONS</h3>
